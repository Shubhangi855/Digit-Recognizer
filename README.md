# Digit-Recognizer

###“Handwritten Digit Recognizing Application” is an android application that will be use to 
recognize handwritten digit and give the best output. This project is to classify an individual 
handwritten word so that handwritten digit can be translated to a digital form. A set of training 
data will be used for this purpose. The objective is to design and implement a digit recognition in 
java that will detect handwritten digits drawn on screen similar to the training data. In this project, 
a simple convolutional neural network [CNN] is created to classify handwriting digits using 
MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

###This topic lies within the ability to develop an efficient 
algorithm that can recognize the handwritten digits which are scanned and sent as input by the 
user. The goal of this paper is to observe the variation of different algorithms that can classify the 
handwritten digits using different hidden layers, various number of epochs and to make a 
comparison based on the accuracy. This experiment is performed using the Modified National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset.
